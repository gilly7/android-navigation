-The Navigation Architecture Component simplifies implementing navigation, while also helping you visualize your app's navigation flow. The library provides a number of benefits, including:

- Automatic handling of fragment transactions
- Correctly handling up and back by default
- Default behaviors for animations and transitions
- Deep linking as a first class operation
- Implementing navigation UI patterns (like navigation drawers and bottom nav**)** with little additional work
- Type safety when passing information while navigating
- Android Studio tooling for visualizing and editing the navigation flow of an app
